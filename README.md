2023 - Smart Contract Developing
Solidity Programming: I have a strong command over the Solidity programming language, which is specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. I am skilled in writing secure, efficient, and well-structured Solidity code. Smart Contract Development: I have hands-on experience in developing and deploying smart contracts on various blockchain platforms. I can create smart contracts that handle complex business logic, interact with external systems, and facilitate secure and transparent transactions. Ethereum Ecosystem: I am well-versed in the Ethereum ecosystem, including Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), and Ethereum development tools like Truffle and Remix. I am knowledgeable about ERC standards (such as ERC-20, ERC-721) and can integrate them into smart contract development.
